# very brief guide: 

1. Create two folders in dataset: 
coco - this is where images go 
cocostuff - this is where labels (as images) go.


2. original coco images are in: 
/lab-share/Rad-Afacan-e2/Public/serge/code/llm/experiments/yolov7/yolov7/coco

this comes from this zip file download: 
coco2017labels-segments.zip

3. coco labels (as images) are not provided with this dataset - 
download them here and extract - 

stuffthingmaps_trainval2017.zip

4. place validation dataset for images in dataset/coco/train2017 
4. place validation dataset for labels in dataset/cocostuff/train2017 

there should be 5000 images.
